                Hi! I'm James Campbell, a web developer from Brooklyn, NY. I kind of wandered into
                the development world as a senior at Baruch College when I registered for a C++
                course and fell absolutely in love with coding. It was all I wanted to do -
                all day, every day. After graduating with a degree in Entrepreneurship &
                Management I continued coding and discovered a passion for web
                development. I'm also equally passionate about business and
                love opportunities to combine the two. If I'm not coding,
                I'm probably reading, working out, or at home with my
                girlfriend watching something with a high IMDB
                rating.
            </p>
            <p>
                I love creating elegant, user-friendly websites. I'm comfortable with HTML, CSS,
                Javascript - including jQuery and AJAX, PHP, and Laravel. There's never a
                period when I'm not learning something new, which is one of the things
                I love about coding and web development.
